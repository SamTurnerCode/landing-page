                “Mjolnir, the lightning-maker, is by far my favourite hammer. 
                I've had broken a great deal of weapons before, normally by hitting
                things with them. Even better, it comes back when I throw it. I've
                had lost a number of excellent weapons by throwing them at things that
                irritated me and missing. It is the finest gift I've ever received."
